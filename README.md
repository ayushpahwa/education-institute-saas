# SaaS for educational coaching institutes

## Synopsis

This project is a management software for educational coaching institutes. It helps the institutes in redundant and tedious tasks like notifying for new cycle's payment, distributing tests and their reports etc.

## Motivation

Coaching institutes are positioned in every city of this country. Many not so well-heeled institutes lack better managing tools. So, we thought to help them by making a Coaching Management Software for automating many of their tasks.

## Installation

--To be decided.--

## API Reference
